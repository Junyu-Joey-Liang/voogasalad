1. Make a map, make an attacker and then play the game.

       change "value" to "cost"
       dynmically drag and turn map cells
       make scrolling thing for everything larger
       
Better error checking for
- info button for different labels for details on what each label is
- Less decimal sliders
-  Change default values to not negative (NEGATIVES WILL THROW ERRORS)
- People don’t pick projects —> have default value
- Able to make projectiles in defender
- Cannot change name in attacker and projectiles
- If level building: clarify income vs values (maybe another info box)
- What is flow type (wee woo wee woo)
- the “can place’ range should be same size as defender
- Doesn’t know how to name game and description
- Add units beside values
- Splash for work flow (what might be the proper order of building)
- Cannot save game bc there is no game title
- Things in text boxes should be saved automatically without pressing submit/enter
- Game should auto pop up in the game GUI after author saves game
- Add a “start” to game (starts after the player places desired defenders)
- ALL AGREE UPON UNITS FOR EVERYTHING IN GENERAL
   - Josh’s thoughts on units
       - Tiles/second for speed
       - Tiles for distance
- Size needs to be removed
- Multiple spawn points
- Multiple end points
- Make 4 separate paths
- Store and save be the same
- No projectiles for attacker
- Add overwrites everything meep
- Clicking on projectile does not work (double click)
- Save changes —> clears to new default for re-edit
- Have something to alert user that they are not saving changes (are you sure you want to navigate away before saving changes)
- Auto save while you type for text boxes
- Remove not showing up
- Cannot set game name
- INFINITE TIME (has to set score for which player wins)
- Loading game is not working is not working in authoring environment
- Having difficulty finding/making map
- Create instruction beside each tab
-
Grey out things
- Change image size when changing size in authoring environment
- Map builder was pretty good (go Khian Wei!)
